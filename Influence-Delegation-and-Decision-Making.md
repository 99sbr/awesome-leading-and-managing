## Influence, Delegation, and Decision-Making

### Avoiding Micro- and Undermanagement

Micromanagement leads to mistrust, lack of autonomy, demotivation.
Undermanagement leads to isolation, bewilderment, cluelessness.
Just-right management (“Goldilocks”) leads to increase in engagement.

### Decision-Making

- [“Do We All Agree” Is a Terrible Question](https://medium.com/@hunterwalk/do-we-all-agree-is-a-terrible-question-14499769591b) - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: We often confuse 'collaboration' with 'consensus.' The former is about engaging a group of people to work together and discuss ideas. It aims to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. The best leaders are certainly collaborative."

- [The 90% Agreement Rule](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa) - by Lawrence Ripsher. Takeaway: Ripsher asserts that "we spend 90% of our time, talking about the 10% of things we disagree on." This takes up time and energy. Instead, "[c]reate clarity (and build on) wherever there is ‘about 90% agreement’ first— then come back around and address the disagreements after."

- [3 Ways To Ease The Pain Of Slow And Frustrating Decision Making](http://corporate-rebels.com/rebellious-practices-distributed-authority/) - by the Corporate Rebels.

Takeaway: A Duke University research study shows that people with high "intellectual humility" are more open to the information coming their way, as a form of "information sensitivity." This means they end up making more informed decisions than those who need to be right and ignore evidence.

- [Why Leaders Who Listen Achieve Breakthroughs](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Why-Leaders-Who-Listen-Achieve-Breakthroughs?__s=ns1epkqjs8qj1ggjuafv) - by Elizabeth Doty. Takeaway: Two-way conversations (as opposed to conversations in which the "sender" of a message focuses on their own half, instead of paying equal attention to the recipient's message and response) can make collaboration occur at a level that can be game-changing. Decisions become better and more reflective/inclusive of different perspectives and information sources.

- [Lazy Leadership](https://medium.com/flow/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959?__s=ns1epkqjs8qj1ggjuafv) - by MetaLab founder Andrew Wilkinson. Takeaway: "I now think of my companies as machines.

If I’m part of the machine, I think about my strengths and weaknesses, and if necessary replace myself with someone better suited to the role."

- [Why Delegate?](https://medium.com/@mags/how-a-single-conversation-with-my-boss-changed-my-view-on-delegation-and-failure-ae5376451c8d#.xucavchj6) - by Margaret Gould Stewart. Takeaway: “If there isn’t something going off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them. You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two, you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”

Takeaway: "[M]anagers should not ask people on the team to do yucky work that the manager doesn’t want to do. Or said another way, if there’s something yucky to be done then managers should join in. That’s all well and good, but is also just basic civility I think."

We all want great outcomes for our respective businesses, but have a hard time bridging the divide."
