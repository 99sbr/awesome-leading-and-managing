## Influence, Delegation, and Decision-Making

### Avoiding Micro- and Undermanagement

Micromanagement leads to mistrust, lack of autonomy, demotivation.
Undermanagement leads to isolation, bewilderment, cluelessness.
Just-right management (“Goldilocks”) leads to increase in engagement.

### Decision-Making

- [Act Last, Read the Room, and Taste the Soup](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup) - by Rands in Repose. Takeaway: In times of decision-making, it's best to go last in expressing your views because by this time, everyone else has provided context you'll need to make the best decision. Also, take the temperature of whatever room you're in so you can communicate effectively, and don't micromanage.

- [Battling Perfectionism](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/battling-perfectionism-713537a8b8b6) - by Julie Zhuo. Takeaway: "The problem is that trying to do things perfectly all the time often leads to worse prioritization decisions when you take a step back...The thing is, perfectionism tends to be rooted in fear rather than opportunity."

- [Business Value Game](https://www.agile42.com/en/business-value-game/) - by Andrea Tomasini. Takeaway: an interactive game in which a "product management board" of stakeholders decides, in a manner inspired by Planning Poker, which goals to prioritize based on relative value to the business.

- [Decide How to Decide: Empowering Product Ownership](https://medium.com/@ellengott/decide-how-to-decide-empowering-product-ownership-97a54be29e7) — by Ellen Gottesdiener. Takeaway: Offers suggestions to help teams and product owners reach decisions without making assumptions about whether they’ve come to a consensus or not and includes a “gradient of agreement”

- [Decision-Making Auditing](http://tomtunguz.com/decision-making-auditing/) - by Tomasz Tunguz. Takeaway: "I’ll never know as much about a company’s operations or strategy or a sector as a founder/management team. But, I still want to be helpful. So, the most effective strategy I’ve found so far is to probe how the decision was made. Answer a question with a trenchant question, which coincidentally, ties back to some of the best advice I’ve received from a founder."
 
 - [Decision Making in a Company with No Managers](https://www.infoq.com/articles/decisions-company-no-managers) - by Jan Zborowski. Takeaway: Ensuring a safe decision-making environment for all employees is a must in a self-managed company. Letting ordinary employees propose an idea and then implement it, to jointly shape the company’s future, results in a low rotation indicator. A flat and transparent business model translates directly into clients’ happiness and a company’s growth.
 
- [“Do We All Agree” Is a Terrible Question](https://medium.com/@hunterwalk/do-we-all-agree-is-a-terrible-question-14499769591b) - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: We often confuse 'collaboration' with 'consensus.' The former is about engaging a group of people to work together and discuss ideas. It aims to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. The best leaders are certainly collaborative."

- [A Framework for Making Smarter Decisions and Fewer Errors](https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/) - by Farnham. Takeaway: Suggests using inversion, second-order thinking, and other concepts, and includes a list of articles for improved decision-making.

- [How to De-Risk a Startup](https://codingvc.com/how-to-de-risk-a-startup/)— by Leo Polovets. Takeaway: lists common risks and heuristics for risk mitigation and decision-making. States that showing is better than telling; external validation is better than personal opinion, and more data is better. Identifies types of risk, from product quality and recruiting to product/market fit.

- [How to Make One of the Most Difficult Decisions as a Manager](https://medium.com/@lnetanel/how-to-make-one-of-the-most-difficult-decisions-as-a-manager-6b1a1f0d1d6a) — by Netanel Lev. Takeaway: Understand that leaving your job as a manager is a process with emotions involved. Find a mentor to guide you through the situation, have an exit plan, don’t blame other people or be blindly loyal, and trust your instincts.

- [How We Make Decisions at Coinbase](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-cd6c630322e9) - by Brian Armstrong. Takeaway: "The vast majority of decisions in a company are low-risk and should be made unilaterally by the owner of that area (e.g. should we move the stand up meeting from Mon to Tues this week). A decision-making framework is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is higher risk. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made." Includes a decision-making template. 

- [In 2018, Focus on Quality of Decision Over Quality of Outcome](https://hunterwalk.com/2018/01/01/in-2018-focus-on-quality-of-decision-over-quality-of-outcome/) - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: "In any system with relatively low cost of failure and repeatable game scenarios, it would seem that getting the decision right is actually what matters."

- [The 90% Agreement Rule](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa) - by Lawrence Ripsher. Takeaway: Ripsher asserts that "we spend 90% of our time, talking about the 10% of things we disagree on." This takes up time and energy. Instead, "[c]reate clarity (and build on) wherever there is ‘about 90% agreement’ first— then come back around and address the disagreements after."

- [Ruthless Prioritization](https://blackboxofpm.com/ruthless-prioritization-e4256e3520a9) — by Brandon Chu. Takeaway: “Estimate return on investment for each project; apply three constraints: dependencies, timeline and team composition, and sequence projects based on ROI and constraints.” Includes a template for triaging bugs as a tool for getting teams to think about priorities.

- [Second-Order Thinking: What Smart People Use to Outperform](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/second-level-thinking/) - by Farnham Street. Takeaway: "Second-order thinkers take into account a lot of what we put into our decision journals. Things like, What is the range of possible outcomes? What’s the probability I’m right? What’s the follow-on? How could I be wrong? The real difference for me is that first-order thinkers are the people that look for things that are simple, easy, and defendable. Second-order thinkers push harder and don't accept the first conclusion."

- [Strategic Decisions: When Can You Trust Your Gut?](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/strategic-decisions-when-can-you-trust-your-gut) - by McKinsey. Takeaway: An interview with psychologist Daniel Kahneman and scientist Gary Klein. “Society’s epitome of credibility is John Wayne, who sizes up a situation and says, ‘Here’s what I’m going to do’—and you follow him. We both worry about leaders in complex situations who don’t have enough experience, who are just going with their intuition and not monitoring it, not thinking about it.”—Klein.

- [3 Ways to Ease the Pain of Slow and Frustrating Decision Making](http://corporate-rebels.com/rebellious-practices-distributed-authority/) - by the Corporate Rebels. Takeaway: Change your language to imply empowerment; distribute decision-making authority by practice, and push decision making authority down through proper training.

- [Why Humble People Make Better Decisions](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/why-humble-people-make-better-decisions-d18e6ad6180a#.hy27xhl36) - by Drake Baer. Takeaway: A Duke University research study shows that people with high "intellectual humility" are more open to the information coming their way, as a form of "information sensitivity." This means they end up making more informed decisions than those who need to be right and ignore evidence.

- [Why Leaders Who Listen Achieve Breakthroughs](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Why-Leaders-Who-Listen-Achieve-Breakthroughs?__s=ns1epkqjs8qj1ggjuafv) - by Elizabeth Doty. Takeaway: Two-way conversations (as opposed to conversations in which the "sender" of a message focuses on their own half, instead of paying equal attention to the recipient's message and response) can make collaboration occur at a level that can be game-changing. Decisions become better and more reflective/inclusive of different perspectives and information sources.

- [Delegate Outcomes, Not Activities](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/delegate-outcomes-not-activities-3aa922c1f55e) - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: "When you delegate the outcomes and not the activities, you help employees not just execute for the task at hand, but equip them for every future task after that. You’re giving true ownership to your team."

- [How to Decide Which Tasks to Delegate](https://hbr.org/2017/07/how-to-decide-which-tasks-to-delegate) - by Jenny Blake. Takeaway: "Conduct an audit using the six T’s to determine what tasks make the most sense to offload"—tiny, tedious, time-consuming, teachable, terrible at, and time-sensitive. Includes a [delegation template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spiyCEvdD4TMyoF12UPwvcZKlTYSCBnoMY1IBJ0idyM/edit#gid=2099757242) you can use as a model for offloading tasks.

- [How to Delegate Better with the 7 Delegation Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZF-G7MCSG4) (video) - by Jürgen Appelo of M 3.0. Takeaway: a quick and clear video outlining seven levels of delegation: tell, sell, consult, agree, advise, inquire and delegate.

Takeaways: Remove mechanisms of control: examples include estimation, meetings, sprints; increase focus (eliminate projects and reduce the number of priorities to 1-2); give authority to choose any approach that would lead to success. Need strong agreement on the goals of the project. If your managing principle is trust and not control, then people matter more than processes do.

Takeaway: categorize the responses in one of three ways: 50% vanish; 25% do the assignment; and 25% make shit happen well beyond what the assignment was—these are the leaders.

- [Lazy Leadership](https://medium.com/flow/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959?__s=ns1epkqjs8qj1ggjuafv) - by MetaLab founder Andrew Wilkinson. Takeaway: "I now think of my companies as machines. I determine the result that I want, design a machine that will produce the result, then figure out what sort of people I need as part of it. If I’m part of the machine, I think about my strengths and weaknesses, and if necessary replace myself with someone better suited to the role."

- [Managing for Progress and the Loss-Aversion Principle](http://tomtunguz.com/progress-principle) - by Tom Tunguz. Takeaway: "The best managers craft roles and assign projects that position their teammates to see and feel the result of their work directly."

- [Situational Leadership Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory) - Wikipedia entry. Takeaways: Proficiency depends on knowledge, ability, and aptitude; commitment describes motivation, interest, enthusiasm, and confidence; different levels of proficiency/commitment need different amounts of direction/support.

- [Why Delegate?](https://medium.com/@mags/how-a-single-conversation-with-my-boss-changed-my-view-on-delegation-and-failure-ae5376451c8d#.xucavchj6) - by Margaret Gould Stewart. Takeaway: “If there isn’t something going off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them. You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two, you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”

- [Management Is Not About Asking People to do Stuff](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/management-is-not-about-asking-people-to-do-stuff-88f105c61838) - by Steven Sinofsky. Takeaway: "[M]anagers should not ask people on the team to do yucky work that the manager doesn’t want to do. Or said another way, if there’s something yucky to be done then managers should join in. That’s all well and good, but is also just basic civility I think."
