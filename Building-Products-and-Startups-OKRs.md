## Building Products and Startups

As a leader of a product development team you might have a PM that you’re working with, but some of your role will involve deciding how/when product is built, who builds what, etc. So you’ll need to level up your product skills.

- [Aligning Projects with Business Goals](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/02/aligning-business-goals-with-projects/) - by Anthony Eden. Provides a simple project management spreadsheet of six questions: 1) What is the problem we are trying to solve?; 2) What does success look like, and how does it fit in the big picture?; 3) What are the MUST DO and the MUST NOT DO items?; 4) What is the deadline?; 5) Who should I talk to for help and get feedback?; 6) Have we done this before? Something we already have to get started?

- [Everyone Forgets Technical Research](https://producthabits.com/everyone-forgets-technical-research/) - by Product Habits. Takeaway: Offers a step-by-step template for creating a 1-3 page technical research outline that will enable product leads to communicate plans more effectively with developers, who can then better do the research on their side required to build a product successfully. "The outline should be a short summary of what you’re looking to create, including required features and functionality. You should also provide guidance on what matters most to you (and customers). What’s the core problem you’re looking to solve, and how do you plan to solve it? What are the most important parts of what you’re building?"

- [Growth Hacking Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uN_kMZlwsdaliiUhIEei5PTnLphm0p6Eo57Xg6LnFHc/edit) - notes by Joe Goldberg.

- [The MVP is dead. Long live the RAT.](https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-is-dead-long-live-the-rat-233d5d16ab02) - by Rik Higham. Takeaway: "There is a flaw at the heart of the term Minimum Viable Product: it’s not a product. It’s a way of testing whether you’ve found a problem worth solving. A way to reduce risk and quickly test your biggest assumption. Instead of building an MVP identify your Riskiest Assumption and Test it. Replacing your MVP with a RAT will save you a lot of pain."

- [On Writing Product Roadmaps](https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c) - by Gaurav Oberoi. Takeaway: "Roadmaps are a tool to think about your product beyond the next couple of sprints. They force you to plan, communicate, and get buy in.

Includes some useful examples of roadmap docs, and proposed schedules for planning and creating your roadmaps.

- [The Product Manager Superpower: User Science](https://medium.com/@tworetzky/the-product-manager-superpower-user-science-7296134ae5a4) - by Brent Tworetzky. Takeaway: "While finding the perfect user-product fit is rarely easy, trained product managers can find great fits consistently with User Science–the field of deeply understanding people interacting with products through rigorous toolings and process. User science involves understanding both user needs (identifying which problem to solve) and user behaviors (understanding how and why users react to products). This distinction is important: winning products need both a meaningful problem to solve and strong execution."

- [Reminder: Your “Product” Company is Just an Implementation Detail](https://medium.com/from-the-start/building-a-feature-697344aefda2) - by Jeremy Baker. Takeaway: The progress our customer wants to make is the most important thing. We think about our features and what they can do, and present them that way. When we do this, we’re "forcing our customer to do the hard work. They have to map features to their process and figure out if it helps them make progress ... Instead, talk about the progress our customer wants to make, and build tools that enable that progress."

- [Scaling Airbnb with Brian Chesky — Class 18 Notes of Stanford University’s CS183C](https://medium.com/cs183c-blitzscaling-class-collection/scaling-airbnb-with-brian-chesky-class-18-notes-of-stanford-university-s-cs183c-3fcf75778358) - by Chris McCann.
